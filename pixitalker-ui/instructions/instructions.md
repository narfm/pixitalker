### **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**  
#### **Title:** Modular Orchestrator for Interactive Learning App  

---

### **Objective**  
Develop a modular orchestrator system for a children’s interactive learning app using Next.js. The orchestrator (Teacher Agent) will route user queries to domain-specific APIs (e.g., Addition, Subtraction), manage session context, and provide personalized feedback to enhance the learning experience.

---

### **Key Features**  

#### **1. Teacher Agent (Orchestrator)**  
- **Role**: Acts as the primary entry point for student interactions.  
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Interpret student queries.  
  - Identify the appropriate operation (addition, subtraction, etc.).  
  - Route the query to the corresponding domain-specific API.  
  - Collect and aggregate progress metrics from individual agents.  
  - Provide session continuity and personalized feedback.  

#### **2. Specialized Agents (APIs)**  
Each specialized agent will operate as a standalone API, focusing on specific domains:  
- **Addition Agent API**: Solves addition problems and provides step-by-step explanations.  
- **Subtraction Agent API**: Handles subtraction queries with detailed guidance.  
- **Future Agents**: Extendable for other operations like multiplication, division, or word problems.  

---

### **User Flow**  
1. **Query Input**: The student enters a query (e.g., “What is 5 + 3?”).  
2. **Intent Analysis**: The Teacher Agent identifies the query intent (e.g., addition).  
3. **Routing**: The Teacher Agent forwards the query to the corresponding API (Addition Agent).  
4. **Response Generation**: The specialized agent processes the query and returns a detailed response.  
5. **Feedback and Progress**: The Teacher Agent aggregates the response, updates the student’s progress, and provides feedback.

### **Functional Requirements**  

#### **Frontend**  
- **Interface**:  
  - Chat interface for the student to interact with the Teacher Agent.  
  - Progress tracking dashboard showing scores, strengths, and improvement areas.  

- **Interactivity**:  
  - Visual representations of math problems using animations (e.g., whiteboard explanations).  
  - Gamification elements like badges or rewards for milestones.  

#### **Backend**  
- **Teacher Agent (Orchestrator)**:  
  - Query parsing and intent classification (e.g., using OpenAI GPT or a custom NLP model).  
  - API routing logic to forward queries to appropriate agents.  
  - Session and progress tracking using a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).  

- **Specialized Agent APIs**:  
  - Stateless APIs for domain-specific operations.  
  - Input validation and error handling (e.g., malformed queries).  
  - Step-by-step problem-solving explanations.  

---

### **Non-Functional Requirements**  

- **Scalability**:  
  - APIs should be horizontally scalable to handle increased load.  
  - Teacher Agent should efficiently manage multiple concurrent sessions.  

- **Performance**:  
  - Query response time should be under 1 second for an optimal user experience.  

- **Security**:  
  - Secure API communication using HTTPS and token-based authentication.  
  - Data privacy compliance (e.g., COPPA for children’s data).

### **System Architecture**  

#### **1. Frontend (Next.js)**  
- **Components**:  
  - **Chat Interface**: For interaction with the Teacher Agent.  
  - **Dashboard**: Displays progress and achievements.  
  - **Whiteboard Animation**: Renders visual explanations of problems.  

- **State Management**:  
  - Use Zustand or Redux for managing application state.  

- **API Communication**:  
  - Fetch Teacher Agent responses via REST or GraphQL APIs.  

#### **2. Backend (Node.js)**  
- **Teacher Agent Service**:  
  - Handles session management and progress aggregation.  
  - Routes queries to specialized agents via internal API calls.  

- **Specialized Agents**:  
  - Implemented as standalone Node.js services (e.g., Express or FastAPI for Python).  
  - Provide domain-specific functionality.  

#### **3. Database**  
- **Type**: Relational or NoSQL (e.g., PostgreSQL or Firebase Firestore).  
- **Usage**:  
  - Store user progress, session data, and learning analytics.  

#### **4. Communication**  
- **Protocol**: REST or gRPC for internal API calls.  
- **Authentication**: Use JWT tokens for securing API requests.

### **API Endpoints**  

#### **Teacher Agent API**  
- `POST /query`: Accepts student queries and routes them to specialized agents.  
- `GET /progress`: Retrieves the student’s progress data.  

#### **Specialized Agent APIs**  
- **Addition Agent**:  
  - `POST /solve`: Solves addition problems and provides explanations.  
- **Subtraction Agent**:  
  - `POST /solve`: Handles subtraction problems and provides step-by-step guidance.  

---

### **Technical Considerations**  
1. **Intent Analysis**: Use GPT or a lightweight NLP model for intent classification within the Teacher Agent.  
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate-limiting to prevent abuse of the APIs.  
3. **Logging**: Use centralized logging for monitoring and debugging (e.g., ELK Stack).  
4. **Extensibility**: New agents can be added without affecting existing functionality.  

---

### **Milestones and Timeline**  
1. **Week 1-2**: Set up the Next.js frontend and initial backend structure.  
2. **Week 3-4**: Implement Teacher Agent with intent analysis and routing logic.  
3. **Week 5-6**: Develop Addition and Subtraction APIs.  
4. **Week 7**: Integrate APIs with the frontend.  
5. **Week 8**: Testing, debugging, and deployment.
